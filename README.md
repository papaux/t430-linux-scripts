# Linux scripts for Lenovo T430

This repository contains a set of scripts I use on with my T430 laptop.
I share them in the hope they could be useful to others!

There is absolutely no warranty that they would work for you in your setup. I'm running ArchLinux with Gnome, so they may need some adaptations to run on your system.

Have fun!
